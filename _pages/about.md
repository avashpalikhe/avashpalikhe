**About Me**

Hi there! 👋 I'm Avash — a researcher, engineer, and lifelong learner passionate about building AI systems that are not just powerful, but also fair and responsible. Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 🌐

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University (FIU), USA.  

💻 I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal.

**Research Interest**

🔍 My research explores the intersection of machine learning, bias detection, and AI fairness. I'm particularly interested in how large language models (LLMs) can unintentionally reinforce social biases — and how we can measure, explain, and mitigate those issues. My goal is to contribute toward more ethical and inclusive AI systems.

🌱 Outside academia, I enjoy meaningful conversations around tech for good, exploring different cultures, and diving into thought-provoking books and ideas.

Thanks for visiting! 😊 Feel free to explore my work, or [get in touch](mailto:avashpalikhework@gmail.com) if you'd like to connect.
